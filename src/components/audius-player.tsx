// This file will be deleted and replaced by spotify-player.tsx
// To reflect this in the XML, I will provide an empty content for this old path
// and a new file for spotify-player.tsx.
// However, the system expects a rename. For the purpose of this AI,
// I will provide the new content under the new filename.
// The actual file operation should be a rename or delete then create.
// For simplicity here, I'll just mark this file as being replaced by the new one.
// The build system should handle the rename.
// If it expects explicit delete and create, this needs adjustment.
// Assuming the system can infer a rename or handle delete + create from new path.
// For now, let's provide the new content under the *new* file path.
// I will make this file empty to signify deletion if the new file content is also provided.
// The instruction is to provide "ENTIRE, FINAL, intended content".
// If the file is deleted, its content is empty.
// However, the operation is more of a rename/replace.
// Let's request a DELETE for the old file and a CREATE for the new one if direct rename isn't supported by the XML.
// The prompt says "When making changes on behalf of the user, you MUST use the following XML-based structure." for "file modifications".
// It does not explicitly state how to handle renames or deletes.
// I will assume that providing an empty CDATA for the old file means delete, and a new file means create.
// If this is not the case, and the file should be renamed, the <file> path should be the new one with the new content.
// Let's try the approach of updating the old filename to the new one, if that's how renames are handled.
// No, the prompt says "Provide the ABSOLUTE, FULL path to the file being modified".
// This implies I cannot change the file path within a <change> block for rename.
// So, I must list the old file (audius-player.tsx) as modified (to be empty, effectively deleting it or making it a different component)
// and then create a new file (spotify-player.tsx).
// This will be two <change> blocks.

// To accurately represent a rename as a delete and create:
// 1. The old file src/components/audius-player.tsx is "deleted" (content becomes empty or it's actually removed from the list of files to be modified if the system handles file deletion separately, but the XML implies modification).
// 2. A new file src/components/spotify-player.tsx is created with the new content.

// The prompt says "Provide the ENTIRE, FINAL, intended content of the file here."
// If a file is effectively renamed, the old path ceases to exist.
// The most straightforward way with the current XML spec is likely to treat it as
// deleting the old file and creating the new file. If the XML supports a 'delete' operation, that's better.
// Lacking that, I will provide empty content for the old file path, which should be interpreted as deleting its content.
// And then provide the new file with its content.

// Let's assume the platform handles a file in <change> that isn't in current user code as a *new file*.
// And if a file *is* in current user code, it's an *update*.
// To delete `audius-player.tsx`, I should probably *not* include it in the <changes> block if the intent is deletion and there's no explicit delete operation.
// However, the prompt says "Most user requests will be to make changes to the app. You can make changes to one or more files".
// This feels like I should list all files *touched*.
// Let's try to make the old file empty and create the new file.
// This is not ideal.
// A better way: I will provide one change block for the *new* file path `spotify-player.tsx` with the new content.
// And then, I will modify `page.tsx` to *use* `spotify-player.tsx`.
// The old `audius-player.tsx` will become an orphan. The user or a cleanup step can remove it.
// This is safer than trying to delete it via empty content, which might be misinterpreted.
// The prompt states: "You generate the plan; you do not execute the changes."
// So, my plan will be: create spotify-player.tsx, update page.tsx.
// The audius-player.tsx file will remain untouched but unreferenced.
// This seems like the safest interpretation of the "modify files" instruction.
// I will tell the user that the old file `audius-player.tsx` is no longer used.

// Re-thinking: The prompt says "When making changes on behalf of the user, you MUST use the following XML-based structure... Provide the ENTIRE, FINAL, intended content of the file here."
// If I rename `audius-player.tsx` to `spotify-player.tsx`, then `audius-player.tsx` should no longer exist.
// The best way to represent a rename given the constraints is:
// 1. A <change> for `audius-player.tsx` with empty content (effectively deleting its contents or signaling for deletion).
// 2. A <change> for `spotify-player.tsx` with the new content (creating it).
// This is what I will do.
